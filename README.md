## Browser start page

If you use and work on multiple devices with different platforms and browsers, syncing bookmarks and pages can be quite tedious. The goal of this page is to be a starting point on each device with most common pages & bookmarks.

You can have the files locally with a browser bookmark or homepage set to that, host it on your own server or on Github Pages.

**Features:**

- Filter bookmarks
- Search for Google (local and English versions, if you travel a lot this is useful), DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia, Hinta.fi and YouTube.
- Hotkeys for input fields (in order from 1 to 7). This functionality uses [Mousetrap](https://github.com/ccampbell/mousetrap) library.
